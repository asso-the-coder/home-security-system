Detailed Log Notes:

8/1/2025
- Connected the PL with the Zynq PS via the AXI, and added a GPIO IP Block to the PL also via AXI 
- Vivado neatly generates Verilog code from the block design, which gets synthesized and implemented
- Before generating the bitstream, I assigned the GPIO blocks to the PMOD connectors using XDC constraints, to read the sensor data
- Generated the bitstream file and exported the HW's configuration to Vitis (as an XSA file) for FreeRTOS to run on top of
- TODO: Will need to add SPI or CAN IP blocks and re-generate the XSA file to achieve low-latency comms with future parts in the project

9/1/2025
 - Adjusted the Block Design by adding a timer, which is required for FreeRTOS interrupt ticks to run properly
 - Used the new XSA to create the "platform component" in Vitis; this is the HW layer that the FreeRTOS app is built upon
 - Built the FreeRTOS app on this platform, and ran Xilinx's Hello World template, which uses RTOS tasks to communicate to my PC over USB (verified on PuTTy)
